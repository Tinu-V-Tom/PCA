# PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Breast Cancer Dataset
Introduction to PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique used to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a lower-dimensional one while retaining as much variance as possible. It achieves this by finding new axes (principal components) that maximize the variance of the data. The first principal component accounts for the most variance, and each subsequent component captures the remaining variance orthogonal to the previous components.
